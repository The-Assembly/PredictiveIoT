# PredictiveIoT
Internet of Things workshop conducted on 19th December 2020 in association with Etisalat Digital and PTC.  In this session, we will take the engine data obtained on the cloud and use ThingWorx Analytics Server to create an engine failure prediction model based on the same. Weâ€™ll use Analytics to visualise and refine our machine learning model iteratively based on statistical methods. Our system will then be able to predict outcomes based on new incoming data in real-time with our early warning capacity automatically improving as more data is made available.
